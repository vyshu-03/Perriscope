<p>Andhra University College of Engineering (AUCE ) had its beginnings in the Composite Madras State before Independence, in 1946. However, the seeds of technical education on Andhra University Campus had been soon in 1933 itself with the inception of Sugar Technology, the present Department of Chemical Engineering. In 1946 after the sanction, the college was initially located at Cocanada (the present Kakinada), under the Madras State. In 1955 after the first bifurcation of the State from the Combined Madras Government, Departments of major branches of Engineering--Mechanical, Civil & Electrical were established on the University Campus. The present AUCE Campus (the North Campus of the Andhra University) had been established in 1955 on a sprawling area extending to 160 acres. The shift had seen the North Campus emerge as the present Andhra University College of Engineering-Autonomous. The department of Chemical Technology i.e Sugar Technology of 1933 was also shifted to the North Campus in 1962 further strengthening the Campus. The four sections of Basic Sciences have been upgraded to individual departments in 1979.

    Over the years AUCE has been growing from strength to strength. Today the Campus offers 17 UG and 35 PG programmes besides research on par with technical institutions worldwide. The strength of the college is its faculty who motivate the students in leading the country in its ongoing technological revolution and entrepreneurial skills.
    
    In a recent survey conducted by a reputed organization AUCE has been rated at first position among the state owned technical institutions in the country (Star News). The strong Alumni Association of the campus contributes its might to the overall development of campus in every way possible; the Dr. YVS Murthy Auditorium, North Campus Health Centre are built by the Alumni. The faculties of the departments are engaged in individual research besides consultancies with public, private and national research organizations.
    
    The college is support by Technical Education Quality Improvement Programme (TEQIP), a World Bank funded project to develop technical education in the country. TEQIP necessitated autonomous status to the College. It is a matter of pride that AUCE stands at No.1 position in implementing the programme in the country. AUCE, is ever ready to help and support public and private organization whenever technical support or otherwise is sought. The successful conduct of the first ever recruitment examination of APCRDA is a feather in the cap of AUCE.
    
    The students of the Campus get placements through its Placement Cell in all major players in the country The natural beauty of the campus with the serene blue waters of the Bay of Bengal on one side and the lush green Kailasagiri Hill on the other beckons academic enthusiasts to the Campus. Welcome to Andhra University College of Engineering (Autonomous), Visakhapatnam, India.</p>

    <p>Andhra University is not just one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, but is also the first to be conceived as a residential and teaching-cum-affiliating University, mainly devoted to post-graduate teaching and research.

    The people of the State have an emotional attachment to the institution, since it came into being after a prolonged and collective struggle of the Telugu elite for a University in the educationally backward northern Circars and Ceded districts of the erstwhile Madras Presidency.
    
    Andhra University was constituted in the year 1926 by the Madras Act of 1926. The 94-year-old institution is fortunate to have Sir C.R. Reddy as its founder Vice-Chancellor, as the steps taken by this visionary proved to be fruitful in the long run.
   <br> 
    Former President of India Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was one of its Vice-Chancellors who succeed Dr. C. R. Reddy in 1931. The University College of Arts was inaugurated on 1 st July, 1931. The inaugural courses were Telugu language and literature, History, Economics and Politics. A year later, the College of Science and Technology came into being with Honours courses in Physics and Chemistry. The University pioneered in introducing many new courses in Science, Arts, Management and Engineering in the country.
    
    The leaders of the university always believed that excellence in higher education is the best investment for the country and engaged the services of famous educationists such as Dr. T.R. Seshadri, Dr. S. Bhagavantham, Professor Hiren Mukherjee, Professor Humayan Kabir and Dr. V.K.R.V. Rao, to mention a few who set high standards for teaching and research. Nobel Lariat C V Raman was the proud alumnus of the University and closely associated in laying research foundations in Physics. Padmavibhushan Prof. C R Rao, the renowned statistician of the world, was also the proud alumnus of the University.
    
    Keeping in pace with the global needs and challenges under the leadership and guidance of successive Vice-chancellors, the University is offering several new Courses of relevance and Contemporary significance.
    
    Ever since its inception in 1926 Andhra University has an impeccable record of catering to the educational needs and solving the sociological problems of the region. The University is relentless in its efforts in maintaining standards in teaching and research, ensuring proper character building and development among the students, encouraging community developmental programmes, nurturing leadership in young men and women and imbibing a sense of responsibility to become good citizens, while striving for excellence in all fronts.</p>
